As study of autism has increased over the past several decades, it has become clear that autism actually comprises a large, heterogeneous set of similar disorders, most of which are genetic in origin. In this class, we will study how neuronal cell biology is disrupted in known forms of autism, and how distinct forms of autism can arise from alterations in common cellular pathways. Further, we will discuss how these discoveries may lead to eventual treatments or cures.",

    "description": "This course emphasizes how to gather data then train, test, and deploy practical machine learning systems using modern software libraries, with an emphasis on scikit-learn, Keras on TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Agents. After garnering working familiarity with learning architectures including linear regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and deep neural networks, students will shift to practicing techniques that leverage state of the art published models via transfer learning. This is a hands-on project-focused course integrating coding activities into lectures. To provide the broadest applicability, datasets will range from rich text, to financial time series, to sound, images, and video, as well as data garnered through game play.",

This course also will host guest speakers from local civic and political organizations who engage in rhetorical practices in the service of civic engagement, which includes the discourse both of people who exercise political power and of citizens who debate over public policies and cultural identity.",

    "description": "This course reviews the nature of crime and disorder in cities from the urban industrial revolution through the so-called \"Crime Drop\" of the early 2000s. The course opens with an overview of urbanization, contrasting the “best” with the “worst” aspects of the industrial revolution on human life. It then examines urban drug markets, violence, and policing before moving into a discussion of the crime \"peak\" of 1992. The course then follows the ensuing crime drop, examining demographic, economic, and cultural factors that may explain the national crime decline. The course then focuses on violence as a public health issue and on how crime, incarceration, health, housing, and education are all tied to urban crime policy.",

This course is designed to gain leverage on these questions by surveying an eclectic literature from international relations and comparative politics.",

This course will examine a selection of themes and topics in feminist theory and research, including violence against women, black feminist thought, transnational feminism, trans rights, and heterosexism, among others. Language, borders, economic inequity, and racism are key levers of power that we will explore in-depth.",

The use of interrupts to implement fixed-rate sampling is introduced along with practical implementation of PID controllers. The Kalman filter is introduced as a stochastic state observer under measurement uncertainty as well as the extended Kalman filter to address non-linear systems.

    "description": "The purpose of the Mathematical Models in Economics course is to cover basic calculus optimization as applied in economics contexts to prepare students for intermediate level economics courses. While the main tools for the course are obviously math tools, they are math used in business and economic analysis, modeling, and research. The course will go over applications of unconstrained and constrained optimization to microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics and make the connections between the tools we cover and their uses. That will also include both single and multi-variate calculus applications and the conditions for optimality. Economic interpretation of the math is more important than the math itself and the real focus of the course.",

In this course we will focus on hate between/among individuals, groups, and populations. We will try to understand how hate develops, what developmental, social, and clinical factors give rise to hate. We will examine prevalent hate groups and how they recruit. And, we will examine ways that we might be able to combat hate, both in broad terms, but even more so at the micro levels.",

The course opens with an overview of urbanization, contrasting the “best” with the “worst” aspects of the industrial revolution on human life. It then examines urban drug markets, violence, and policing before moving into a discussion of the crime \"peak\" of 1992. The course then follows the ensuing crime drop, examining demographic, economic, and cultural factors that may explain the national crime decline. The course then focuses on violence as a public health issue and on how crime, incarceration, health, housing, and education are all tied to urban crime policy.",

Because data and analytics are an important component of digital marketing, students will also become proficient at using data to evaluate a marketing campaign. One of the best ways to assess marketing strategies is through A/B testing and students will become expert at planning, analyzing and reporting A/B tests. We will also discuss strategies for integrating data-based decision making into organizations.",

Using methods of contemporary production, each student will undergo the process of designing a product and developing presentable drawings that will be used to fabricate their parts for final assembly. Within this course, there will be an emphasis on computer aided systems that augment conceptual exploration and rapid manufacturing techniques. Vocabulary will be developed via an understanding of and engagement with tooling capabilities, CAD modeling, critical dialogue and investigating the relationship between design and fabrication.",

The course will go over applications of unconstrained and constrained optimization to microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics and make the connections between the tools we cover and their uses. That will also include both single and multi-variate calculus applications and the conditions for optimality. Economic interpretation of the math is more important than the math itself and the real focus of the course.",

By examining the significance of appearance, rooted in the body, through the lens of social and critical theory, we unravel how it interconnects with the principles, conduct, and standards of fashion design. Through the application of these theoretical frameworks, we probe into various subject positions to gain insights into the current landscape of fashion design. This course equips students with the knowledge to inspire transformative change throughout the fashion industry.",
